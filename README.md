# IBEV (Intent-Based Execution Vault)

A smart contract vault where users submit intents instead of explicit transactions, enabling simplified and optimized on-chain interactions.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**: This project is currently in the early stage of brainstorming. This README serves as a placeholder and will be updated as the project evolves.

## 🎯 Overview

**[Coming Soon]**

IBEV aims to revolutionize transaction execution by allowing users to express their intentions rather than crafting explicit transactions. This approach simplifies user experience while enabling solvers to optimize execution strategies.

## ✨ Key Features

**[To Be Defined]**

- Intent-based transaction submission
- Automated execution optimization
- Solver network integration
- Gas-efficient execution
- Cross-chain intent support (future)

## 🔄 How It Works

**[Documentation In Progress]**

1. User submits intent to the vault
2. Solvers compete to fulfill the intent optimally
3. The best execution path is selected
4. Transaction executed and settled on-chain

## 🏗️ Architecture

**[Under Development]**

Detailed architecture diagrams and technical specifications will be added here.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

| Contract | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| IntentVault | Main vault for intent storage | Planned |
| SolverRegistry | Manages approved solvers | Planned |
